"We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play.   On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth."



"Within Google, we sometimes say, “Software engineering is programming integrated over time.” Programming  is certainly a significant part of software engineering: after all, programming is how you generate new software in the first place. If you accept this distinction, it also becomes clear that we might need to delineate between programming tasks (development) and software engineering tasks (development, modification, maintenance). The addition of time adds an important new dimension to programming. Cubes aren’t squares, distance isn’t velocity. Software engineering isn’t programming."


A Engenharia de software em si diz respeito a um projeto de forma geral, não só a programação se faz essencial, mas todos os passos no desenvolvimento do projeto, desde seu funcionamento, tempo de execução até a experiência do usuário. Na Engenharia de software também é importante considerar os possíveis erros que podem ocorrer com a utilização do software, por isso é necessário analisar alternativas para uma manutenção mais eficiente.
